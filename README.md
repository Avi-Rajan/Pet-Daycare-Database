# Pet Daycare Management System
This project aims to develop a robust SQL database system tailored for managing a doggy daycare facility. Built using SQL Developer, the system features essential tables for client data, dog profiles, and appointment scheduling. Advanced functionalities include automated reminders, comprehensive reporting, and integration capabilities with front-end applications.

Key features:

Database Design: Implements primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity, following fundamental database normalization principles.
SQL Query Optimization: Utilizes stored procedures and optimized queries to enhance performance and scalability.
Automated Triggers: Employs SQL triggers for appointment reminders and enforcing business rules.
Mock Data: Populated with realistic mock data to simulate real-world scenarios.
This project is inspired by personal experiences and aims to provide a cost-effective alternative to existing pet boarding services like Rover.
